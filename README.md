# OpenCV
Introduction
OpenCV is an open-source standardized resume format designed to be both human-readable and machine-friendly. Built using JSON, this format aims to simplify the job application process by making it easy for automated systems to parse resume content. Say goodbye to the hassle of filling out the same information over and over again!

Features
Multilingual Support: Apply for jobs globally without language barriers.
Flexible: Customize your resume by adding or removing sections as needed.
Automation-Friendly: Easily readable by automated systems to streamline job applications.

Usage
Refer to the respective documentation for each library to understand how to read, write, and manipulate ResumeJSON files.
